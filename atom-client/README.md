# Atom Client Module


This module will periodically fetch from one or more Atom feed sources and send a MOTECH event for each feed content that changed since the last fetch.

The fetch job is triggered by a MOTECH event with the `org.motechproject.atomclient.fetch` subject. The module will periodically send a fetch event based on the schedule in the cron expression in the `atom-client-defaults.properties` file. The Atom feed(s) to fetch are specified in the `atom-client-feeds.json` file. Should a feed content have changed since the last fetch, the module will send a `org.motechproject.atomclient.feedchange` event for each individual content change. Additionally a regex can be specified and will be used to extract specific parts of the feed content to be put on the `feedchange` event payload.

This module is currently designed to work primarily with the Atom feed generated by the [OpenMRS Atom feed module](https://github.com/ICT4H/openmrs-atomfeed) on [OpenMRS](http://openmrs.org/) servers.
Likely more work will be needed to make it a full fledged generic Atom feed client.
